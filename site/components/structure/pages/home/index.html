  <h3>Body text example</h3>

  <div class="body-text example">
    <p>
      What makes design strong and perfect is uniformity: a few design elements used and reused all over again.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fonts, headings, links, colors, navigation, lists, backgrounds, separators, forms, images&mdash;we
      have already ten elements all mandatory parts of a website.
      You can use a couple of font families, you have to have at least three headings,
      you need at least a couple of colors, you have more than one navigation block, and multiple backgrounds.
    </p>

    <p>
      From ten basic design elements you are already over twenty or thirty at least.
      People can focus on five content blocks at once&mdash;this might be true also for design elements.
